# Radiology Report

## Patient Information

    Name: Dr. Girish Jethwa  
    Age: 58 Years  
    Gender: Male  
    Referred by: Self  
    Date of Examination: 16 April 2025  

## Investigation Method

    1.5 T MRI of the Left Shoulder  

## Technique

    Imaging Sequences:  
        - SE T1W Sagittal and Coronal  
        - FSE T2W Coronal & Axials  
        - T2GE Axials  
        - T2 Fat Suppression Sagittal  

## Findings

    - **Thickened and indistinct inferior joint capsule** with associated fluid collection and distension of the axillary pouch. The joint capsule measures between 3.0 to 3.5 mm in thickness, which is indicative of capsular pathology.
    
    - **Minimal fluid presence** in the gleno-humeral joint and along the bicipital tendon sheath, suggesting mild inflammation or irritation.
    
    - **Subchondral cyst/geode** at the superior aspect of the humeral head, potentially indicative of early degenerative changes or stress-related bone response.
    
    - **Intrasubstance hyperintensity** in the antero-superior labrum, raising the possibility of degenerative changes which may correlate with clinical symptoms.
    
    - **Minimal fluid noted** in the subacromial bursa, indicating mild bursitis without any significant impingement.
    
    - The acromial contour is normal, with **no evidence of impingement**. The muscles around the shoulder and their attachments appear normal, ruling out any muscular pathology.

## Impression

    The imaging findings are consistent with **adhesive capsulitis**, characterized by the thickening of the joint capsule and fluid accumulation. The presence of a subchondral cyst at the humeral head and degenerative changes in the labrum suggest concurrent degenerative joint disease processes.

## Conclusion

    The MRI findings suggest adhesive capsulitis of the left shoulder with associated mild degenerative changes. The subchondral cyst at the humeral head and labral degeneration should be correlated with clinical findings for comprehensive management. Consideration of therapeutic interventions targeting capsular distension and potential degenerative changes may be beneficial.
